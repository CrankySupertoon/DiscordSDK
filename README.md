Contents are not my work. They were copied from [what Discord publicly provides to developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide).
I wanted to include the SDK as a cmake-compatible submodule in some of my cross-platform projects, and this was a convenient way for me to do so.
